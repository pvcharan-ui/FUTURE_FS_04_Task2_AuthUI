# 🔐 Task 2 – Animated Authentication UI  
*ApexPlanets 60 Days Internship – FUTURE_FS_04*

This repository contains my **Task 2 submission**, where I developed a fully animated and responsive **Login / Register Authentication UI** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only**.

This task focuses purely on **frontend design** and **client-side validation**.  
(No PHP or database yet — backend comes in Task 3.)
